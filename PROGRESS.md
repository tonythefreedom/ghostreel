# GhostReel — Progress

Newest first. Each entry: what is true now, what broke, what is next. Keep it short; long output goes in files.

## 2026-10-24 · H0 — kickoff

Done
- Mission and one-line idea written and handed to Ted for submission (they live in PRD.md › Submission).
- The six docs landed: PRD, ARCHITECTURE, DESIGN, RULES, TASKS, PROGRESS.
- Shorti public MCP verified from a server, no key: `POST https://shorti.ai/mcp` `initialize` → 200,
  `tools/list` → `shorti_video`, `shorti_format`, `shorti_what_to_shoot`, `shorti_find`, `shorti_check`,
  `shorti_recipe`, `shorti_arena`.
- Repo `tonythefreedom/ghostreel`: public, default branch `master`, Ted has push.

Broke
- Nothing yet.

Open (owner)
- NEWTYPE server path: endpoint, token, real render latency per format (B, T3).
- Whether `shorti_check` works keyless or needs a signed-in token (A, T14).
- Upstash Redis provisioned or in-memory for the demo (A, T1).
- Brand: DESIGN.md is a working proposal; Ted decides.

Next
- T1 (A) scaffold and first prod deploy; T2 (A+B) agree `lib/types.ts`; T3 (B) NEWTYPE path.
